<p>I am currently a student at University Centre Peterborough studying Computing and Information Systems. I would say that I am equally creatively and technically minded, with the ability to learn quickly.</p>
<p>I like to develop my programming skills in my spare time which has made me quite the perfectionist. I try to find the most efficient solution to a problem and re-evaluate my methodology to find the best possible way to implement a solution.</p>
<p>I would say I work well in teams as well as on my own and will work my hardest to ensure my role is being fulfilled to not let the team down. </p>
