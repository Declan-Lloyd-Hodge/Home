<p>For one of the modules in my university degree we had to produce an application for a real client in teams. This required teams of 4 to distribute roles and work as a unit to produce the application based on the client's specifications/feedback. The team I was lead developer of produced an application that both looked good and functioned well, which the client decided was the best for his needs out of the 5 teams.</p>
<p>I spent 2 weeks at Accent Nene where i worked as an IT Support Assistant which required me to maintain server ports, image laptops using Ghost32, set up employee phone answering machine accounts, as well as other general software and hardware maintenance.</p>
<p>I spent 2 weeks at 3 Ways Crash Repair where i worked as a Paint Technician. For this role i had to prepare car parts for painting as well as wash, buff and polish cars for the clients to pick up.</p>
<p>I have constructed 3 Computers for myself and friends from scratch using parts that I have advised them to get based on their requirements.</p>
