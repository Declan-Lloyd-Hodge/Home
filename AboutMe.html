<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<hr />
<p>I am Declan Hodge, Welcome to my website.</p>
<p>
    I'm a Software and Web Developer living in Peterborough. I have a passion for UI and UX design, but can adapt to other development roles as I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, VB.Net, ASP.Net, PHP, LUA, C#, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server
    2008 and Microsoft Access.
</p>
<p>I enjoy experimenting with new graphical styles and challenging visual designs as it helps me to develop my skills. When programming I try to take the most efficient approach while making my code as maintainable as possible.</p>
<p>
    I am currently trying to improve my skills in various ways, such as improving my understanding of SOLID principles as well as experimenting with new languages such as C++ and Angular JS. I am also trying to improve my 3D art skills in the hopes of
    someday becoming part of the Games industry.
